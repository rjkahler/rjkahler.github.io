This repository includes the code and sources for my  CMPS 6070 final project

My project is entitled Heisman Candidate Anlysis and I seek to explore if the Hesiman trophy is truly distributed to the best college footabll player in recent years, or if helmet and position bias has affected the results.

All data is scraped from these two sources: https://www.sports-reference.com, https://www.wikipedia.org
